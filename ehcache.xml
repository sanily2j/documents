<defaultCache maxElementsInMemory="10000" overflowToDisk="true" eternal="false" timeToIdleSeconds="600" timeToLiveSeconds="3600" diskPersistent="false" diskExpiryThreadIntervalSeconds="120" memoryStoreEvictionPolicy="LRU" />


maxElementsInMemory: The maximum number of elements that can be stored in memory.
overflowToDisk: Whether elements should overflow to disk when the memory limit is reached.
eternal: If set to true, the elements in the cache will never expire.
timeToIdleSeconds: The maximum time an element can stay in the cache without being accessed.
timeToLiveSeconds: The maximum time an element can stay in the cache regardless of access.
diskPersistent: Whether the disk store persists between restarts.
diskExpiryThreadIntervalSeconds: The interval at which the disk store expiry thread runs.
memoryStoreEvictionPolicy: The policy used to evict elements from the memory store (e.g., LRU - Least Recently Used)

In production  timeToIdleSeconds="600" timeToLiveSeconds="3600"  should not be kept 0
also diskStorePath should not point to /tmp folder , use insteaed custom folder 

when u migrate your application from ehcache 1.5 to 2.x , you need to add in 2.x version in ehcache.xml file xsd schema location inside <ehcache> tag .
  In absence of that , you will have unexpected  behviour in production
