Why parallelStream() May Degrade Performance in Spring Batch
Spring Batch Already Manages Threads:

Spring Batch is designed to handle parallel processing efficiently using its own thread management (e.g., TaskExecutor, Partitioner, or Multi-threaded Step).
Introducing parallelStream() adds another layer of parallelism, which can lead to thread contention and resource exhaustion.
Thread Contention:

parallelStream() uses the common ForkJoinPool by default, which shares threads with other parts of the application.
If Spring Batch is already using a thread pool, adding parallelStream() can cause contention for CPU and memory resources, leading to degraded performance.
Shared Resources:

In your code, the page object is a shared instance variable. Using parallelStream() without proper synchronization can lead to race conditions and unpredictable behavior.
Overhead of Managing Threads:

parallelStream() introduces additional overhead for splitting tasks, managing threads, and merging results. This overhead may outweigh the benefits, especially
if Spring Batch is already optimized for parallel processing.

When to Avoid parallelStream()
If Spring Batch is already configured for parallel processing (e.g., using a TaskExecutor or Partitioner).
If the workload is I/O-bound (e.g., reading/writing files) rather than CPU-bound.
If the dataset is small, as the overhead of managing threads in parallelStream() may outweigh the benefits.

When to Use stream()
Sequential Processing: When you want to process files one at a time in the order they appear in the list.
Avoiding Overhead: When you want to avoid the overhead of managing additional threads (as with parallelStream()).
Spring Batch Integration: When Spring Batch is already handling parallelism (e.g., via TaskExecutor or Partitioner).
When to Avoid stream()
If you need to process files in parallel to improve performance, stream() may not be sufficient. In such cases, consider using Spring Batch's built-in parallel processing features (e.g., multi-threaded steps or partitioning).
Comparison: stream() vs. parallelStream()

Feature	stream()	parallelStream()
Processing	Sequential |	Parallel
Thread Management	Single-threaded |	Uses ForkJoinPool (multi-threaded)
Overhead	Minimal	| Higher due to thread management
Order of Processing	Maintained	 | Not guaranteed
Use Case	Sequential processing, low overhead	| Parallel processing for large datasets


The ForkJoinPool is a special thread pool introduced in Java 7 as part of the java.util.concurrent package. It is designed to efficiently execute tasks that can be broken down into smaller subtasks (a process called divide-and-conquer) and then combined to produce the final result. It is the foundation of parallelism in Java's Stream API and parallelStream().

Key Features of ForkJoinPool
Work-Stealing Algorithm:

The ForkJoinPool uses a work-stealing algorithm, where idle threads "steal" tasks from other threads' queues to keep the CPU busy and improve performance.
This ensures efficient utilization of threads in the pool.
Divide-and-Conquer:

Tasks submitted to the ForkJoinPool are recursively split into smaller subtasks using the fork() method.
Once the subtasks are small enough, they are executed, and their results are combined using the join() method.
Parallelism:

The ForkJoinPool is optimized for parallelism and is used internally by Java's parallelStream() and CompletableFuture.
Common Pool:

Java provides a common ForkJoinPool that is shared by all parallelStream() and CompletableFuture tasks unless explicitly overridden.
The size of the common pool is determined by the number of available processors (Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors()).
How ForkJoinPool Works
Task Submission:

Tasks are submitted to the ForkJoinPool using the invoke(), execute(), or submit() methods.
Task Splitting:

The task is split into smaller subtasks using the fork() method. Each subtask is added to the pool's task queue.
Task Execution:

Worker threads in the pool execute the tasks. If a thread becomes idle, it steals tasks from other threads' queues.
Task Joining:

The results of the subtasks are combined using the join() method to produce the final result.
