When we are getting memory leakage issue in Struts application when server is shutdown and it restarts then  we get memory leakages 
or resources DB issues, this is because some threads are not closed properly ( DB threads) leading to shoortage of DB resourcesd when server starts 
To avoid this we can create a class that implements ServletWebListener annonated by @WebListener and override method contextDestroyed .
This method is called whenever the server is shutdown ( and in tthis method we can check if any datasource is open we can explicity shutdown all open DB resources)
